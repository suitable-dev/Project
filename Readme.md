### Title: Seamless Cryptocurrency and Fiat Interoperability on Sui Blockchain

#### Abstract:
This project introduces an innovative lending protocol built on the Sui Blockchain, designed to facilitate seamless interoperability between cryptocurrency and fiat. Our solution bridges the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems, offering users unmatched convenience, ease, and flexibility.

#### Function of the Project:
Our protocol enables the smooth exchange of value between cryptocurrency and fiat, allowing clients to:

- *Send/Transfer Fiat*: Beneficiaries can receive cryptocurrency directly when they are sent fiat but they want crypto.
- *Send Cryptocurrencies*: Beneficiaries can receive fiat funds when they are sent crypo but they want fiat.

This eliminates cumbersome swapping processes, streamlines transactions, and reduces associated costs. 

Additionally, our solution provides clients with the option to stake both fiat and cryptocurrency, allowing them to earn attractive annual percentage yields (APYs) on their investments. A standout feature of this protocol is the ability to access loans using either fiat or cryptocurrency as collateral. This empowers users to borrow either crypto or fiat for various purposes, including trading, business expenses, bills, and more.

In our DEX, users can stake fiat alongside crypto and enjoy the high APYs of Web3. Users can borrow crypto using fiat as collateral, enabling trading without purchasing crypto outright, and vice versa. The platform allows seamless payments where users can pay someone in crypto, who will receive fiat, and vice versa.

#### Technical Implementation:
- *Frontend Repository*: [Frontend Code](https://github.com/suitable-dev/suitable-real-frontend)
- *Smart Contract Repository*: [Smart Contract Code](https://github.com/suitable-dev/Sui-DEX)
- *Backend Repository*: [Backend Code](https://github.com/suitable-dev/suit-able-backend)

Our backend was built using Java to integrate with local banks, ensuring compliance without relying on real-world assets. The DEX is developed using Sui Move, with a dedicated token to reward users for their engagement. Ethereum (ETH) deployed on Sui represents cryptocurrency, while the Nigerian Naira in the DApp symbolizes fiat.

### Future Development Plans:
As our project is currently simulated for testing purposes, we aim to transition to the mainnet, utilizing real-world assets and collaborating with financial institutions. Our vision is to onboard billions of users onto the Sui Blockchain, enhancing accessibility and usability in decentralized finance.

#### Key Future Development Goals:
1. *Mainnet Transition*: Move from a simulated environment to the mainnet, integrating real-world assets and establishing partnerships with financial institutions.
2. *User Onboarding*: Develop strategies to onboard billions of users, making the platform accessible to a wider audience.
3. *Enhanced Solutions*: Address complexities encountered during development by refining our solutions based on user feedback.
4. *Hackathon Participation*: Continue to improve our project in preparation for upcoming hackathons, incorporating additional features to enhance functionality.
5. *Ecosystem Revolution*: Our ultimate goal is to revolutionize the decentralized finance ecosystem by providing innovative, user-friendly solutions that bridge traditional finance and blockchain technology.

We are committed to overcoming the challenges faced during development and are excited about the potential impact our project can have on the financial landscape.
